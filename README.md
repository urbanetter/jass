Jass
====

A small experiment how much it takes to teach the computer to play Jass (a Swiss card game) in PHP.

It is very very basic and should be structured quite differently, probably. But it was quite quick to write and you could extend it a lot now...

Run it yourself
---------------
```
git clone git@github.com:urbanetter/jass.git
cd jass
composer dumpautoload
cd tests
php manual.php
```
